Netmask
=======

The Netmask class parses and understands IPv4 CIDR blocks so they can be explored and compared. This module is highly inspired by [node-netmask](https://github.com/rs/node-netmask) module.

Installation
-----------

```shell
$ composer require grntartaglia/netmask
```

Synopsis
--------

```php
$block = new Netmask\Netmask('192.168.0.1/24');
$block->base;                       // 192.168.0.0
$block->mask;                       // 255.255.255.0
$block->bitmask;                    // 24
$block->hostmask;                   // 0.0.0.255
$block->broadcast;                  // 192.168.0.255
$block->size;                       // 256
$block->first;                      // 192.168.0.1
$block->last;                       // 192.168.0.254

$block->contains('192.168.0.7/24'); // true
$block->contains('192.168.0.126');  // true
$block->contains('192.168.1.1');    // false

// ['192.168.0.1', '192.168.0.2', '192.168.0.3', ...]
$block->getAll();

foreach ($block->getAll() as $ip) {
    // IP: 192.168.0.x
}
```

Constructing
------------

Netmask objects are created with an IP address and optionally a mask. There are many forms that are recognized:

```php
new Netmask('192.168.0.1/24');            // The preferred form.
new Netmask('192.168.0.1');               // A /32 block.
new Netmask('192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0');
```

API
---

- `->base`: The base address of the network block as a string (eg: 216.240.32.0). Base does not give an indication of the size of the network block.
- `->mask`: The netmask as a string (eg: 255.255.255.0).
- `->hostmask`: The host mask which is the opposite of the netmask (eg: 0.0.0.255).
- `->bitmask`: The netmask as a number of bits in the network portion of the address for this block (eg: 24).
- `->size`: The number of IP addresses in a block (eg: 256).
- `->broadcast`: The blocks broadcast address (eg: 192.168.1.0/24 => 192.168.1.255)
- `->first`, `->last`: First and last useable address
- `->contains($ip or $block)`: Returns a true if the IP number `$ip` is part of the network. That is, a true value is returned if `$ip` is between `$base` and `$broadcast`. If a Netmask object or a block is given, it returns true only of the given block fits inside the network.
- `->getAll()`: Returns an array with all the useable addresses, ie between `$first` and `$last`.
- `->__toString()`: The netmask in base/bitmask format (e.g., '216.240.32.0/24')
